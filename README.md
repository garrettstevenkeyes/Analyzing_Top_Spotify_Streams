# Background

Music streaming company Spotify launched in Europe in 2008 and at the time most people in the US used either Apple music or the radio to listen to music. Three years later in 2011 Spotify launched in the US and became the leading force in the music streaming business. In 2017, it bough Tencent music and vice verse, kept enlarging the territory of its music leadership role globally. It has been a NYSE public company since 2018. What is most interesting is that this is where lots of data scientists favorite place to work with.

We are interested in an overall picture of the users of spotify. Our "stakeholder" are potentially from a musical festival organizations. They want to know some insights on Spotify users and some key artists to book for their next music festivals.

# Hypothesis

## 1. Does the streaming country have a significant impact on the number of streams?
--- First of all, we want to have a holistic picture of the users globally, according to the statistics from Statistica, Spotify' major users are from Europe, Latin America and North America, but we want to confirm whether the latest weekly users's demographic information plays a role on the weekly streams.
 
We want to look at the following hypotheses:

H0: The means of weekly number of streams on spotify on all country groups are equal

H1: The means of weekly number of streams on spotify on at least one country group is different.
 
## 2. Do the most popluar artists in each region of the world have different danceability ratings?
--- When organizing a music festival it is important to understand what the festival-goers want from their expereince. Traditionally a key part of the music festival experience is dancing with other festival goers. But not every region of the world may have the same desire for dancability.   
 
We want to look at the following hypotheses:

H0: All regions of the world have equal dancability in their most listend to artists.

H1: The artist dancability for each region's favorite arists are not statistically similar.

## 3. Do people want to listen to artists that make more dancable music?
--- Many artists may have not interest in the dancability of their music. But as a music festival, do you want to book artists you dont make danceable music?


We want to look at the following hypotheses:

H0: Dancability has not effect on the number of streams a song receives. 

H1: People listen to more dancable music more often.

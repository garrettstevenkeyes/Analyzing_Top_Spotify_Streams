Three years after, Spotify launched its company in the US and then it became the music streaming leader since then. In 2017, it bough Tencent music and vice verse, kept enlarging the territory of its music leadership role globally. It has been a NYSE public company since 2018. What is most interesting is that this is where lots of data scientists favorite place to work with.
 We are interested in an overall picture of the users of spotify. Our "stakeholder" are potentially from a musical festival organizations. They want to know some insights on Spotify users and some key artists to book for their next music festivals.
 
 --- First of all, we want to have a holistic picture of the users globally, according to the statistics from Statistica, Spotify' major users are from Europe, latin America and North America, we are curious to first confirm the latest weekly users's demographic information and see if it plays a role on the weekly streams.
 
 We want to look at the following hypotheses:
 H0: The means of weekly number of streams on spotify on all country groups are equal
 H1: The means of weekly number of streams on spotify on at least one country group is different.
